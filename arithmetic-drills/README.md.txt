# Arithmetic Drills Application

## Introduction
The Arithmetic Drills Application is a simple web-based tool designed to assist kids with arithmetic drills. It generates a set of arithmetic problems and prompts the user to provide answers. After completing the drill, the application provides a score out of 10 to evaluate the user's performance.

## Functional Requirements
### Problem Generation
- The application generates arithmetic problems randomly.
- Each problem consists of two operands and an operator.
- Supported operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (ร), and division (รท).
- The operands for addition and subtraction are within the range of 0 to 50, while for multiplication and division, they are within the range of 1 to 12.

### User Interaction
- The application provides a user-friendly interface to facilitate the drill.
- It presents each arithmetic problem to the user and prompts for an answer.
- The user can submit answers using the "Enter" key or by clicking the "Submit" button.

### Answer Validation
- The application validates the user's answer for each problem and provides immediate feedback on correctness.

### Scoring
- At the end of the drill, the application calculates and displays a score out of 10 based on the number of correctly answered problems.

### Restart or Exit
- The application provides an option to restart the drill or exit the program after completing the exercise.

## Non-functional Requirements
### User Interface
- The user interface is visually appealing and responsive.
- It provides clear instructions and feedback to the user.

### Performance
- The application responds quickly to user inputs and generates arithmetic problems without noticeable delays.

### Platform Compatibility
- The application is developed as a standalone program that can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and popular mobile operating systems like Android and iOS.

### Error Handling
- The application handles any unexpected errors gracefully, displaying clear error messages and providing options to recover or exit the program.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a timer to track the time taken by the user to complete the drill.
- Add options for customizing the difficulty level, such as selecting the range of operands or enabling timed drills.
- Include additional arithmetic operations or advanced math concepts for older students.
- Integrate sound effects or animations to make the application more engaging for young users.

## Programming Language
- The application is developed using JavaScript.
- JavaScript was chosen for its wide support, versatility, and compatibility with web browsers.

## Credits
- The application was developed by Abongile Melane.
- Inspiration and assistance were drawn from various online resources and tutorials.
